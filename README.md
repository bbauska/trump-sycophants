"Will there be any accountability for these recent billionaire enablers of Donald Trump, 
who saw what damage he caused and still stood by him?"
</blockquote>

That's the question asked Tuesday by Chuck Collins, director of the Project on Inequality 
and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, following the release of a new 
analysis that identified 63 U.S. billionaires--worth a combined $243 billion--who 
collectively gave $33 million to the Trump Victory Fund over the last two years leading 
up to the 2020 presidential election.

In the wake of last week's insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob 
incited by the president himself, Collins said these "titans of our economy have no right 
to feel shocked" over what happened.

"They enabled Donald Trump. They bankrolled his campaigns. And they cheered as Trump cut 
their taxes, swept away regulations that pinched their profits, and packed the courts 
with judges eager to wink at their transgressions," said Collins.

The Trump Victory Fund through which these individuals showed their support to the 
president and bankrolled the wider pro-Trump movement was created as a joint fundraising 
account for the Trump 2020 campaign and the Republican National Committee. In a 
statement on Tuesday, IPS detailed the top ten billionaires who gave to the fund as:

<ol type="1">
  <li>Gas pipeline magnate Kelcy Lee Warren, worth $2.9 billion, gave eight donations 
    totaling $2,248,906.</li>
  <li>Retired CEO of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac Perlmutter, is worth $5.8 billion and 
    donated $1,871,200.</li>
  <li>Telecommunications mogul Kenny Troutt, worth $1.5 billion, donated $1,849,000.</li>
  <li>Biotech investor Robert Duggan, worth $2.6 billion, donated $1,638,200 to the Trump 
    Victory Fund. In the final days of the campaign, Duggan gave $4.6 million to various 
	Trump campaign groups, according to Forbes.</li>
  <li>Casino magnate Steve Wynn, worth $3 billion, contributed over $1,523,500.</li>
  <li>Casino owner, Phillip Gene Ruffin, worth $2.3 billion, donated $1,375,000.</li>
  <li>Owner of ABC Supply, the giant home supplier, Diane Hendricks $8 billion (Forbes), 
    donated $1,175,000.</li>
  <li>Casino megadonor Sheldon Adelson, and his wife Miriam Adelson, worth over $35.9 
    billion (Forbes), contributed $1.16 million, along with massive donations to other 
	Republican PACs and candidates.</li>
  <li>Texas Banker Daniel Andrew Beal, worth $7.5 billion, gave $1,161,200.</li>
  <li>Software entrepreneur David Duffield, worth $13.3 billion, donated $1,151,600.</li>
</ol>

Included in that list is Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnet and far-right supporter of 
Israel's apartheid policies, who died Tuesday. Other notable billionaires in the total 
list include: Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, worth $20.9 billion, who gave $355,000; 
Hedge fund manager John Paulson, worth $4.2 billion, who donated $831,372; and Johnson 
& Johnson heir Robert Wood Johnson IV, worth $2.5 billion, who contributed $575,000.

"Unlike those who gave to the 2016 campaign but distanced themselves from Trump after 
seeing him in action," lamented Collins, "these billionaires and plenty of others gave 
substantial donations in 2019 and 2020, when it was clear that Trump was causing a 
crisis in our democracy."

<ol>
  <li>Timothy Mellon<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $76.5 million | Net worth: Nearly $1 billion<br>
    <p>Mellon keeps a low profile–he’s rarely photographed and lists a P.O. box in a 1,000-
      person Wyoming town as his address–but no donor has made a bigger splash this election. 
      An heir to an American fortune that dates back more than a century, he made some money 
      of his own in the railroad industry. Mellon has given more than $75 million to a pro-
      Trump PAC (including a $50 million gift the day after Trump’s felony conviction) and 
      another $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p></li>
  <li>Linda McMahon (spouse of Vince McMahon)<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $16 million | Net worth: $3.1 billion<br>
    <p>McMahon and her husband Vince (now disgraced by sexual misconduct allegations that he 
	  denies) built World Wrestling Entertainment into a billion-dollar entertainment 
	  juggernaut. She has been involved in politics for years, running unsuccessfully for 
	  Senate in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and then serving as head of the Small Business 
	  Administration under Trump. She’s still close to the center of the MAGA orbit, chairing 
	  the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policy Institute, serving on the board of Truth 
	  Social’s parent company, Trump Media and Technology Group and having contributed more 
	  than $15 million to Trump’s PACs.</p></li>
  <li>Diane Hendricks<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $6.3 million | Net worth: $20.9 billion<br>
	<p>On the stage at the Republican National Convention in her home state of Wisconsin last 
	  month, Hendricks celebrated her title of America’s richest self-made woman, spoke about 
	  her pro-life views and accused the Biden-Harris administration of stifling 
	  entrepreneurship. A former Playboy bunny, her building materials company ABC Supply 
	  now does $20 billion in yearly revenue. “I know how hard it is to build a company from 
	  nothing,” she said. “And we need a president who understands that too.” She clearly 
	  believes Trump fits the bill: she has already poured more than $6 million into groups 
	  that support him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Miriam Adelson<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $5.8 million | Net worth: $27.8 billion<br>
	<p>A medical doctor and the widow of casino magnate and longtime Republican megadonor 
	  Sheldon Adelson, Israeli-born Miriam Adelson now owns a majority stake in the Las Vegas 
	  Sands casino empire and the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks. The Adelsons gave an eye-popping 
	  $220 million to Republican causes in 2020, and Miriam is continuing to give big sums in 
	  the wake of Sheldon’s death in 2021. She has spent more than $20 million this cycle, 
	  almost all of which came on a single day in May. According to a New York Times report, 
	  Adelson plans to spend more than $90 million to support Trump (she’s given $5.8 million 
	  so far), but she has a few requests: “Be less bombastic” and “speak more directly about 
	  the economy.” She may not follow through on the full amount though–over the weekend, 
	  the Times reported that she and Trump recently exchanged a series of angry texts, 
	  during which the former president said her PAC was run by “Republicans in name only.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>Kelcy Warren<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $5.8 million | Net worth: $6.2 billion<br>
    <p>Warren’s publicly-listed Energy Transfer is best known for the highly controversial 
      Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump helped expedite in one of his first acts in 
      office. Warren had given $100,000 to help elect him in 2016, then dropped more than 
      $11 million in 2020. He’s shelled out close to $6 million this time around, though he 
      also gave some money to Florida Gov. and Trump primary challenger Ron DeSantis last year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Timothy Dunn<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $2.2 billion<br>
    <p>Trump reportedly pushed for $1 billion in contributions from oil executives during a May 
	  meeting, but Dunn is among those who didn’t need any asking–he cut a $5 million check to 
	  Trump’s super-PAC back in December. Dunn’s West Texas-based well operator CrownQuest is 
	  one of the country’s largest private oil companies. He wasn’t on the Trump train in 
	  2016, but he started donating in 2020 and has scaled up his giving to Trump and other 
	  Republicans this cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Elizabeth Uihlein<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $6 billion<br>
</li>

  <li>Richard Uihlein<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $6 billion<br>

<p>Liz and Dick Uihlein are among the GOP’s most generous donors, giving tens of millions 
per cycle. They started the packaging-materials company Uline from their basement in 
1980. Now it does more than $6 billion per year in sales and the catalog–which ran to 
more than 800 pages this year–often includes political messages from Liz, the company’s 
president. In 2021, the catalog celebrated Trump’s “America First” trade policies and 
called out publicly-held companies for being “too concerned about their stock share 
price.” The Uihleins, meanwhile, own 100% of their company and can broadcast their 
political views and pour millions of dollars–$75 million so far this cycle–into 
Republican campaigns without worrying about what shareholders might think.</p>
</li>

  <li>Jeff Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $4.9 million | Net worth: $1.1 billion<br>

<p>Loeffler knows how expensive campaigns can be: She raised $92 million running for Senate 
in Georgia in 2020 but still lost to Raphael Warnock. Loeffler has been a donor longer 
than she has been a politician–she was briefly appointed to Georgia’s Senate seat in 
2020, but she has been giving big sums to Republicans for over a decade. Her husband 
Jeff Sprecher is the founder of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York 
Stock Exchange, and where Loeffler once served as an executive. Together, they’ve given 
nearly $5 million to back Trump. A spokesperson for Loeffler told Forbes that the couple 
also gave $1 million to help put on the Republican National Convention last month, which 
they consider to be a gift in support of Trump. And they plan to give more. Just this 
past weekend, the couple contributed another $170,000 to one of Trump’s committees at a 
fundraiser in Colorado.</p>
</li>

  <li>Phil Ruffin<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $3.3 million | Net worth: $2.6 billion<br>

<p>Ruffin is a major Trump donor, but he is also a business partner and close friend. The 
two co-own the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and Ruffin married his wife 
Oleksandra at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump served as his best man. Ruffin has stood behind 
Trump since 2016, but he upped the ante for 2024. His $3.3 million in gifts to Trump’s 
PACs and committees so far this cycle are more than his donations in the last two 
elections combined.</p>
</li>

  <li>Jimmy John Liautaud<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $3.1 million | Net worth: $2.4 billion<br>

<p>Jimmy John turned the sandwich chain that he started in an Illinois garage into a 2,600-
location empire, cashing out in 2016 when he sold the majority of his business to a 
private equity firm. Since then, he has gotten more involved in politics, as has his 
wife Leslie. She backed Trump in 2016 and 2020, but her husband hadn’t joined her until 
now. Jimmy John has wasted no time, giving $2.8 million to Trump groups so far, and 
Leslie has thrown in another $250,000.</p>
</li>

  <li>Geoffrey Palmer<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $3 million | Net worth: $3.1 billion<br>

<p>Palmer’s real estate company owns more than 11,000 apartments in the Los Angeles area, 
making him one of the city’s largest landlords. He’s also perhaps the most controversial: 
Palmer has been involved in politics–in California and beyond–for decades, and he ran 
afoul of state campaign finance laws in the ’90s. He need not worry about that on the 
federal level, where super-PACs can accept unlimited sums. He gave more than $6 million 
to Trump-aligned PACs between 2016 and 2020, and he’s up to $3 million in 2024.</p>
</li>

  <li>Bernard Marcus<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $2.7 million | Net worth: $9.9 billion<br>

<p>Marcus, 95, cofounded Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978. Over the years, the 
cofounders have gone to battle in federal elections, with Blank giving millions to 
Democrats while Marcus pours millions into the GOP. Marcus got into the MAGA movement 
early, donating more than $5 million to Trump-supporting super PACs in 2016 and another 
$10 million in 2020. An Atlanta resident, he has also spent big on the recent and 
highly pivotal Senate races in Georgia. Together with his wife Billi, Marcus has 
contributed $2.7 million to help elect Trump in 2024.</p>
</li>

  <li>Robert “Woody” Johnson<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $2.7 million | Net worth: $3.3 billion<br>

<p>An heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune and the owner of the New York Jets, Johnson 
served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. While in office Trump reportedly 
asked him to help secure the British Open for his Scotland golf resort. The former 
ambassador couldn’t do that, but he’s proven a trusty fundraiser, giving $2.7 million, 
along with his wife Suzanne, and helping to court Republican megadonors who left the 
fold after Jan. 6, according to CNBC. After a Trump fundraiser in Palm Beach in April, 
he talked to Fox News about the state of the GOP donor class: “everybody’s back.”</p>
</li>

  <li>Kenny Troutt<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $2.2 million | Net worth: $1.7 billion<br>

<p>Two things Troutt has been plowing his telecom fortune into: horses and Republican 
politicians. In 2018, he and his wife Lisa gave $1.3 million to the GOP’s midterm 
efforts–and his horse Justify became just the second to win the Triple Crown in the 
21st century, bringing in almost $4 million in earnings. The couple have been Trump 
donors since 2016, though they gave some money to DeSantis during the primaries. 
Make no mistake, though: They’re firmly back on the Trump train, having now given 
more than $2 million to help return him to the White House.</p>
</li>

  <li>George Bishop<br>
Donation to Trump groups: $2 million | Net worth: $3.2 billion<br>

<p>The 86-year-old started oil-and-gas producer GeoSouthern Energy in 1981, then cashed 
out, selling $6 billion in assets to Devon Energy in 2013. Bishop has been giving to 
Republican causes consistently since 2012, making six-figure donations to Trump in 
2016 and 2020, before adding another comma to his contributions this cycle, with $1.5 
million flowing into Trump’s PACs and committees. His wife Kathy chipped in with 
$500,000 of her own. The couple clearly have a lot to give. In 2023, they established 
a $100 million scholarship fund at George’s alma mater, Mississippi State University.</p>
</li>

  <li>J. Joe Ricketts<br>
    Donation to Trump groups: $2 million | Net worth: $3.6 billion<br>
    <p>Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, capitalized on the online trading 
	  revolution to grow his small brokerage firm into the financial service giant TD 
	  Ameritrade, now a subsidiary of Charles Schwab. He and his wife Marlene–who poured 
	  $3 million into a Republican anti-Trump group back in 2016–have given a combined $2 
	  million to Trump groups so far this cycle. But the TD Ameritrade fortune flows to 
	  both sides of the aisle: their daughter Laura, the first openly lesbian owner of a 
	  major sports franchise, has recently emerged as a prominent Democratic donor. “The 
	  free enterprise system and individualism have been at the heart of American 
	  prosperity,” J.Joe Ricketts said in a statement to Forbes explaining his support 
	  for Trump. “I support candidates who are committed to preserving those core 
	  American values.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>Andrew Beal<br>
    Donations to Trump groups: $1.8 million | Net worth: $12.2 billion<br>
    <p>Beal has made a fortune buying up distressed assets–including during the savings and loan 
	crisis and in the wake of the great recession–and has made headlines for his high-stakes 
	poker games and interest in math: In 1997, he established a $1 million prize for the 
	first person to prove or disprove a conjecture he formulated based on Fermat’s Last 
	Theorem. Lately, he’s increasingly bet big on Republican politics. Beal gave more than 
	$4 million Trump committees and other GOP groups in 2020, and he has now put $1.8 million 
	behind Trump’s 2024 bid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cameron Winklevoss<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1.3 million | Net worth: $2.7 billion<br>
</li>
  <li>Tyler Winklevoss<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1.3 million | Net worth: $2.7 billion<br>

<p>The identical twins–jokingly referred to in “The Social Network” as the “Winklevii”—are 
best known for claiming that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook. They received 
$65 million in a 2008 settlement, which they plowed into timely investments in bitcoin 
and ethereum. The twins seem to do everything together. They rowed at Harvard and Oxford 
and at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and cofounded the Gemini crypto exchange (which, earlier 
this year, was forced by regulators to return $1.1 billion to customers after a fund it 
allowed users to lend their crypto to went bust). And they have made nearly identical 
contributions to pro-Trump groups this cycle: $1.3 million each. The youngest donors on 
the list, at 42, and newcomers to the MAGA fold, they represent a new wave of crypto 
enthusiast and tech founder Trump donors. Some of their contributions went to America 
PAC, a pro-Trump super-PAC that Elon Musk says he helped start.</p>
</li>

  <li>Don Ahern<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $1 billion<br>

<p>Don Ahern owes much of his estimated $1 billion fortune to renting construction 
equipment. He also owns an off-the-strip Vegas hotel that has become a popular site 
for conservative gatherings–especially during the pandemic, when Ahern was willing to 
eat government fines for breaking social-distancing rules. He is a true Trump loyalist. 
Unlike some megadonors, Ahern didn’t throw any cash toward Trump’s primary challengers, 
and he has been giving to the 2024 effort for almost three years, with his total now 
up to $1.1 million.</p>
</li>

  <li>Roger Penske<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $6.3 billion<br>

<p>The legendary race car driver built a multibillion-dollar auto business empire and 
expanded his racing legend as the owner of Team Penske, which has won the Indianapolis 
500 20 times. For years, Penske wasn’t among the largest Republican donors, and he gave 
to Republican groups that opposed Trump during the 2016 primaries. But in 2019, the 
former president honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, not long after 
Penske cut his first check to support Trump’s reelection. He’s back in for $1.1 million 
so far in 2024.</p>
</li>

  <li>Steve Wynn<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $3.4 billion<br>

<p>Wynn’s last name is plastered on the sweeping facades of casinos in Vegas and Macau, but 
his ex-wife now controls the empire. He stepped down in the wake of sexual assault 
allegations he has denied in 2018, but that has not stopped his political giving. Wynn 
has donated more than $1 million to groups that support Trump this cycle. His wife 
Andrea also likes to cut huge checks to the GOP, though she is yet to back Trump.</p>
</li>
  <li>Richard Kurtz<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $1 billion<br>

<p>In 2022, Forbes discovered that a series of anonymous donations to Dr. Mehmet Oz’s Senate 
campaign had come from Kurtz, a real estate tycoon, who, it turned out, was a billionaire. 
He no longer seems afraid to sign his checks with his own name. While he only really got 
started as a donor in 2022, he has made up for lost time, giving over $1 million to 
Trump’s 2024 effort. He was also one of the largest donors to vice presidential nominee 
J.D. Vance’s 2022 Senate bid. “I personally recommended [Vance] at a private dinner with 
President Trump,” he told Forbes. “I thought J.D. Vance would be an outstanding Vice 
President.”</p>
</li>

  <li>(tie). Antonio Gracias<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $1.2 billion<br>

<p>Gracias, who has his own private equity firm, built his fortune by making an early bet 
on Tesla. A friend of Elon Musk, he has been deeply involved in the car manufacturer’s 
operations, serving on the firm’s board for years and at times sleeping in Tesla plants 
while scrambling to fix supply chain issues. He also served on the board of SpaceX, 
another Musk enterprise where Gracias has a stake. Gracias’ campaign finance disclosures 
show a rapid political transformation–perhaps a parallel to Musk’s highly public shift 
toward the right. Just four years ago, Gracias was a major Biden donor, giving $360,000 
to one of his fundraising committees. In 2024, he has given exclusively Republicans, 
including a $1 million check to the Musk-linked, pro-Trump America PAC.</p>
</li>

  <li>(tie). Douglas Leone<br>
Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $7.9 billion<br>

<p>Unlike many others on Silicon Valley’s right wing who have embraced the GOP more 
recently, Leone has been giving to Republican candidates for years. He ran the 
legendary VC firm Sequoia Capital, which helped him amass an estimated $7.8 billion 
fortune. Fellow Sequoia billionaire Michael Moritz is one of the top donors to the 
Harris (formerly Biden) campaign, but Leone is with Trump. He gave $1 million to 
America PAC in June, though he also gave $2 million to support DeSantis’ primary 
effort last year.</p>
