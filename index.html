          </blockquote>
          <p>That's the question asked Tuesday by Chuck Collins, director of the Project on 
		    Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, following 
			the release of a new analysis that identified 63 U.S. billionaires--worth a 
			combined $243 billion--who collectively gave $33 million to the Trump Victory 
			Fund over the last two years leading up to the 2020 presidential election.</p>
          <p>In the wake of Jan 6, 2020 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building by a 
		    pro-Trump mob incited by the president himself, Collins said these "titans of 
			our economy have no right to feel shocked" over what happened.</p>
          <p>"They enabled Donald Trump. They bankrolled his campaigns. And they cheered as 
		    Trump cut their taxes, swept away regulations that pinched their profits, and 
			packed the courts with judges eager to wink at their transgressions," said 
			Collins.</p>
          <p>The Trump Victory Fund through which these individuals showed their support to 
		    the president and bankrolled the wider pro-Trump movement was created as a joint 
			fundraising account for the Trump 2020 campaign and the Republican National 
			Committee. In a statement on Tuesday, IPS detailed the top ten billionaires 
			who gave to the fund as:</p>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>Gas pipeline magnate <b>Kelcy Lee Warren</b>, worth $2.9 billion, gave eight 
			  donations totaling $2,248,906.</li>
            <li>Retired CEO of Marvel Entertainment, <b>Isaac Perlmutter</b>, is worth $5.8 
			  billion and donated $1,871,200.</li>
            <li>Telecommunications mogul <b>Kenny Troutt</b>, worth $1.5 billion, donated 
			  $1,849,000.</li>
            <li>Biotech investor <b>Robert Duggan</b>, worth $2.6 billion, donated $1,638,200 
			  to the Trump Victory Fund. In the final days of the campaign, Duggan gave $4.6 
			  million to various Trump campaign groups, according to Forbes.</li>
            <li>Casino magnate <b>Steve Wynn</b>, worth $3 billion, contributed over $1,523,500.</li>
            <li>Casino owner, <b>Phillip Gene Ruffin</b>, worth $2.3 billion, donated $1,375,000.</li>
            <li>Owner of ABC Supply, the giant home supplier, <b>Diane Hendricks</b> 
			  $8 billion (Forbes), donated $1,175,000.</li>
            <li>Casino megadonor <b>Sheldon Adelson</b>, and his wife <b>Miriam Adelson</b>, 
			  worth over $35.9 billion (Forbes), contributed $1.16 million, along with massive 
			  donations to other Republican PACs and candidates.</li>
            <li>Texas Banker <b>Daniel Andrew Beal</b>, worth $7.5 billion, gave $1,161,200.</li>
            <li>Software entrepreneur <b>David Duffield</b>, worth $13.3 billion, donated 
			  $1,151,600.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Included in that list is <b>Sheldon Adelson</b>, the casino magnet and far-right 
		    supporter of Israel's apartheid policies, who died Tuesday. Other notable 
			billionaires in the total list include: Blackstone CEO <b>Stephen Schwarzman</b>, 
			worth $20.9 billion, who gave $355,000; Hedge fund manager <b>John Paulson</b>, 
			worth $4.2 billion, who donated $831,372; and Johnson & Johnson heir <b>Robert 
			Wood Johnson IV</b>, worth $2.5 billion, who contributed $575,000.</p>
          <p>"Unlike those who gave to the 2016 campaign but distanced themselves from 
		    Trump after seeing him in action," lamented Collins, "these billionaires and 
			plenty of others gave substantial donations in 2019 and 2020, when it was clear 
			that Trump was causing a crisis in our democracy."</p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Timothy Mellon</b><br>
              Donations to Trump groups: $76.5 million | Net worth: Nearly $1 billion<br>
              <p>Mellon keeps a low profile–he’s rarely photographed and lists a P.O. box 
			  in a 1,000-person Wyoming town as his address–but no donor has made a bigger 
			  splash this election. An heir to an American fortune that dates back more 
			  than a century, he made some money of his own in the railroad industry. Mellon 
			  has given more than $75 million to a pro-Trump PAC (including a $50 million 
			  gift the day after Trump’s felony conviction) and another $25 million to 
			  support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p></li>
            <li><b>Linda McMahon</b> (spouse of Vince McMahon)<br>
              Donations to Trump groups: $16 million | Net worth: $3.1 billion<br>
              <p>McMahon and her husband Vince (now disgraced by sexual misconduct allegations 
			  that he denies) built World Wrestling Entertainment into a billion-dollar entertainment 
              juggernaut. She has been involved in politics for years, running unsuccessfully for 
              Senate in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and then serving as head of the Small Business 
              Administration under Trump. She’s still close to the center of the MAGA orbit, chairing 
              the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policy Institute, serving on the board of Truth 
              Social’s parent company, Trump Media and Technology Group and having contributed more 
              than $15 million to Trump’s PACs.</p></li>
            <li><b>Diane Hendricks</b><br>
              Donations to Trump groups: $6.3 million | Net worth: $20.9 billion<br>
              <p>On the stage at the Republican National Convention in her home state of Wisconsin last 
              month, Hendricks celebrated her title of America’s richest self-made woman, spoke about 
              her pro-life views and accused the Biden-Harris administration of stifling 
              entrepreneurship. A former Playboy bunny, her building materials company ABC Supply 
              now does $20 billion in yearly revenue. “I know how hard it is to build a company from 
              nothing,” she said. “And we need a president who understands that too.” She clearly 
              believes Trump fits the bill: she has already poured more than $6 million into groups 
              that support him.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Miriam Adelson</b><br>
              Donations to Trump groups: $5.8 million | Net worth: $27.8 billion<br>
              <p>A medical doctor and the widow of casino magnate and longtime Republican megadonor 
              Sheldon Adelson, Israeli-born Miriam Adelson now owns a majority stake in the Las Vegas 
              Sands casino empire and the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks. The Adelsons gave an eye-popping 
              $220 million to Republican causes in 2020, and Miriam is continuing to give big sums in 
              the wake of Sheldon’s death in 2021. She has spent more than $20 million this cycle, 
              almost all of which came on a single day in May. According to a New York Times report, 
              Adelson plans to spend more than $90 million to support Trump (she’s given $5.8 million 
              so far), but she has a few requests: “Be less bombastic” and “speak more directly about 
              the economy.” She may not follow through on the full amount though–over the weekend, 
              the Times reported that she and Trump recently exchanged a series of angry texts, 
              during which the former president said her PAC was run by “Republicans in name only.”</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Kelcy Warren</b><br>
            Donations to Trump groups: $5.8 million | Net worth: $6.2 billion<br>
            <p>Warren’s publicly-listed Energy Transfer is best known for the highly controversial 
              Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump helped expedite in one of his first acts in 
              office. Warren had given $100,000 to help elect him in 2016, then dropped more than 
              $11 million in 2020. He’s shelled out close to $6 million this time around, though he 
              also gave some money to Florida Gov. and Trump primary challenger Ron DeSantis last year.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Timothy Dunn</b><br>
            Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $2.2 billion<br>
            <p>Trump reportedly pushed for $1 billion in contributions from oil executives during a May 
            meeting, but Dunn is among those who didn’t need any asking–he cut a $5 million check to 
            Trump’s super-PAC back in December. Dunn’s West Texas-based well operator CrownQuest is 
            one of the country’s largest private oil companies. He wasn’t on the Trump train in 
            2016, but he started donating in 2020 and has scaled up his giving to Trump and other 
            Republicans this cycle.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Elizabeth Uihlein</b><br>
            Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $6 billion
          </li>
          <li><b>Richard Uihlein</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $5 million | Net worth: $6 billion<br>
          <p>Liz and Dick Uihlein are among the GOP’s most generous donors, giving tens of millions 
          per cycle. They started the packaging-materials company Uline from their basement in 
          1980. Now it does more than $6 billion per year in sales and the catalog–which ran to 
          more than 800 pages this year–often includes political messages from Liz, the company’s 
          president. In 2021, the catalog celebrated Trump’s “America First” trade policies and 
          called out publicly-held companies for being “too concerned about their stock share 
          price.” The Uihleins, meanwhile, own 100% of their company and can broadcast their 
          political views and pour millions of dollars–$75 million so far this cycle–into 
          Republican campaigns without worrying about what shareholders might think.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Jeff Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $4.9 million | Net worth: $1.1 billion<br>
          <p>Loeffler knows how expensive campaigns can be: She raised $92 million running for Senate 
          in Georgia in 2020 but still lost to Raphael Warnock. Loeffler has been a donor longer 
          than she has been a politician–she was briefly appointed to Georgia’s Senate seat in 
          2020, but she has been giving big sums to Republicans for over a decade. Her husband 
          Jeff Sprecher is the founder of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York 
          Stock Exchange, and where Loeffler once served as an executive. Together, they’ve given 
          nearly $5 million to back Trump. A spokesperson for Loeffler told Forbes that the couple 
          also gave $1 million to help put on the Republican National Convention last month, which 
          they consider to be a gift in support of Trump. And they plan to give more. Just this 
          past weekend, the couple contributed another $170,000 to one of Trump’s committees at a 
          fundraiser in Colorado.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Phil Ruffin</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $3.3 million | Net worth: $2.6 billion<br>
          <p>Ruffin is a major Trump donor, but he is also a business partner and close friend. The 
          two co-own the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, and Ruffin married his wife 
          Oleksandra at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump served as his best man. Ruffin has stood behind 
          Trump since 2016, but he upped the ante for 2024. His $3.3 million in gifts to Trump’s 
          PACs and committees so far this cycle are more than his donations in the last two 
          elections combined.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Jimmy John Liautaud</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $3.1 million | Net worth: $2.4 billion<br>
          <p>Jimmy John turned the sandwich chain that he started in an Illinois garage into a 2,600-
          location empire, cashing out in 2016 when he sold the majority of his business to a 
          private equity firm. Since then, he has gotten more involved in politics, as has his 
          wife Leslie. She backed Trump in 2016 and 2020, but her husband hadn’t joined her until 
          now. Jimmy John has wasted no time, giving $2.8 million to Trump groups so far, and 
          Leslie has thrown in another $250,000.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Geoffrey Palmer</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $3 million | Net worth: $3.1 billion<br>
          <p>Palmer’s real estate company owns more than 11,000 apartments in the Los Angeles area, 
          making him one of the city’s largest landlords. He’s also perhaps the most controversial: 
          Palmer has been involved in politics–in California and beyond–for decades, and he ran 
          afoul of state campaign finance laws in the ’90s. He need not worry about that on the 
          federal level, where super-PACs can accept unlimited sums. He gave more than $6 million 
          to Trump-aligned PACs between 2016 and 2020, and he’s up to $3 million in 2024.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Bernard Marcus</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $2.7 million | Net worth: $9.9 billion<br>
          <p>Marcus, 95, cofounded Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978. Over the years, the 
          cofounders have gone to battle in federal elections, with Blank giving millions to 
          Democrats while Marcus pours millions into the GOP. Marcus got into the MAGA movement 
          early, donating more than $5 million to Trump-supporting super PACs in 2016 and another 
          $10 million in 2020. An Atlanta resident, he has also spent big on the recent and 
          highly pivotal Senate races in Georgia. Together with his wife Billi, Marcus has 
          contributed $2.7 million to help elect Trump in 2024.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Robert “Woody” Johnson</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $2.7 million | Net worth: $3.3 billion<br>
          <p>An heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune and the owner of the New York Jets, Johnson 
          served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. While in office Trump reportedly 
          asked him to help secure the British Open for his Scotland golf resort. The former 
          ambassador couldn’t do that, but he’s proven a trusty fundraiser, giving $2.7 million, 
          along with his wife Suzanne, and helping to court Republican megadonors who left the 
          fold after Jan. 6, according to CNBC. After a Trump fundraiser in Palm Beach in April, 
          he talked to Fox News about the state of the GOP donor class: “everybody’s back.”</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Kenny Troutt</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $2.2 million | Net worth: $1.7 billion<br>
          <p>Two things Troutt has been plowing his telecom fortune into: horses and Republican 
          politicians. In 2018, he and his wife Lisa gave $1.3 million to the GOP’s midterm 
          efforts–and his horse Justify became just the second to win the Triple Crown in the 
          21st century, bringing in almost $4 million in earnings. The couple have been Trump 
          donors since 2016, though they gave some money to DeSantis during the primaries. 
          Make no mistake, though: They’re firmly back on the Trump train, having now given 
          more than $2 million to help return him to the White House.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>George Bishop</b><br>
          Donation to Trump groups: $2 million | Net worth: $3.2 billion<br>
          <p>The 86-year-old started oil-and-gas producer GeoSouthern Energy in 1981, then cashed 
          out, selling $6 billion in assets to Devon Energy in 2013. Bishop has been giving to 
          Republican causes consistently since 2012, making six-figure donations to Trump in 
          2016 and 2020, before adding another comma to his contributions this cycle, with $1.5 
          million flowing into Trump’s PACs and committees. His wife Kathy chipped in with 
          $500,000 of her own. The couple clearly have a lot to give. In 2023, they established 
          a $100 million scholarship fund at George’s alma mater, Mississippi State University.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>J. Joe Ricketts</b><br>
          Donation to Trump groups: $2 million | Net worth: $3.6 billion<br>
          <p>Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, capitalized on the online trading 
          revolution to grow his small brokerage firm into the financial service giant TD 
          Ameritrade, now a subsidiary of Charles Schwab. He and his wife Marlene–who poured 
          $3 million into a Republican anti-Trump group back in 2016–have given a combined $2 
          million to Trump groups so far this cycle. But the TD Ameritrade fortune flows to 
          both sides of the aisle: their daughter Laura, the first openly lesbian owner of a 
          major sports franchise, has recently emerged as a prominent Democratic donor. “The 
          free enterprise system and individualism have been at the heart of American 
          prosperity,” J.Joe Ricketts said in a statement to Forbes explaining his support 
          for Trump. “I support candidates who are committed to preserving those core 
          American values.”</p>

          <li><b>Andrew Beal</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1.8 million | Net worth: $12.2 billion<br>
          <p>Beal has made a fortune buying up distressed assets–including during the savings and loan 
          crisis and in the wake of the great recession–and has made headlines for his high-stakes 
          poker games and interest in math: In 1997, he established a $1 million prize for the 
          first person to prove or disprove a conjecture he formulated based on Fermat’s Last 
          Theorem. Lately, he’s increasingly bet big on Republican politics. Beal gave more than 
          $4 million Trump committees and other GOP groups in 2020, and he has now put $1.8 million 
          behind Trump’s 2024 bid.</p>

          <li><b>Tyler Winklevoss</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1.3 million | Net worth: $2.7 billion<br>
          <p>The identical twins–jokingly referred to in “The Social Network” as the “Winklevii”—are 
          best known for claiming that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook. They received 
          $65 million in a 2008 settlement, which they plowed into timely investments in bitcoin 
          and ethereum. The twins seem to do everything together. They rowed at Harvard and Oxford 
          and at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and cofounded the Gemini crypto exchange (which, earlier 
          this year, was forced by regulators to return $1.1 billion to customers after a fund it 
          allowed users to lend their crypto to went bust). And they have made nearly identical 
          contributions to pro-Trump groups this cycle: $1.3 million each. The youngest donors on 
          the list, at 42, and newcomers to the MAGA fold, they represent a new wave of crypto 
          enthusiast and tech founder Trump donors. Some of their contributions went to America 
          PAC, a pro-Trump super-PAC that Elon Musk says he helped start.</p>

          <li><b>Don Ahern</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $1 billion<br>
          <p>Don Ahern owes much of his estimated $1 billion fortune to renting construction 
          equipment. He also owns an off-the-strip Vegas hotel that has become a popular site 
          for conservative gatherings–especially during the pandemic, when Ahern was willing to 
          eat government fines for breaking social-distancing rules. He is a true Trump loyalist. 
          Unlike some megadonors, Ahern didn’t throw any cash toward Trump’s primary challengers, 
          and he has been giving to the 2024 effort for almost three years, with his total now 
          up to $1.1 million.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Roger Penske</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $6.3 billion<br>
          <p>The legendary race car driver built a multibillion-dollar auto business empire and 
          expanded his racing legend as the owner of Team Penske, which has won the Indianapolis 
          500 20 times. For years, Penske wasn’t among the largest Republican donors, and he gave 
          to Republican groups that opposed Trump during the 2016 primaries. But in 2019, the 
          former president honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, not long after 
          Penske cut his first check to support Trump’s reelection. He’s back in for $1.1 million 
          so far in 2024.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Steve Wynn</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1.1 million | Net worth: $3.4 billion<br>
          <p>Wynn’s last name is plastered on the sweeping facades of casinos in Vegas and Macau, but 
          his ex-wife now controls the empire. He stepped down in the wake of sexual assault 
          allegations he has denied in 2018, but that has not stopped his political giving. Wynn 
          has donated more than $1 million to groups that support Trump this cycle. His wife 
          Andrea also likes to cut huge checks to the GOP, though she is yet to back Trump.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Richard Kurtz</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $1 billion<br>
          <p>In 2022, Forbes discovered that a series of anonymous donations to Dr. Mehmet Oz’s Senate 
          campaign had come from Kurtz, a real estate tycoon, who, it turned out, was a billionaire. 
          He no longer seems afraid to sign his checks with his own name. While he only really got 
          started as a donor in 2022, he has made up for lost time, giving over $1 million to 
          Trump’s 2024 effort. He was also one of the largest donors to vice presidential nominee 
          J.D. Vance’s 2022 Senate bid. “I personally recommended [Vance] at a private dinner with 
          President Trump,” he told Forbes. “I thought J.D. Vance would be an outstanding Vice 
          President.”</p>

          <li>(tie). <b>Antonio Gracias</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $1.2 billion<br>
          <p>Gracias, who has his own private equity firm, built his fortune by making an early bet 
          on Tesla. A friend of Elon Musk, he has been deeply involved in the car manufacturer’s 
          operations, serving on the firm’s board for years and at times sleeping in Tesla plants 
          while scrambling to fix supply chain issues. He also served on the board of SpaceX, 
          another Musk enterprise where Gracias has a stake. Gracias’ campaign finance disclosures 
          show a rapid political transformation–perhaps a parallel to Musk’s highly public shift 
          toward the right. Just four years ago, Gracias was a major Biden donor, giving $360,000 
          to one of his fundraising committees. In 2024, he has given exclusively Republicans, 
          including a $1 million check to the Musk-linked, pro-Trump America PAC.</p>

          <li>(tie). <b>Douglas Leone</b><br>
          Donations to Trump groups: $1 million | Net worth: $7.9 billion<br>
          <p>Unlike many others on Silicon Valley’s right wing who have embraced the GOP more 
          recently, Leone has been giving to Republican candidates for years. He ran the 
          legendary VC firm Sequoia Capital, which helped him amass an estimated $7.8 billion 
          fortune. Fellow Sequoia billionaire Michael Moritz is one of the top donors to the 
          Harris (formerly Biden) campaign, but Leone is with Trump. He gave $1 million to 
          America PAC in June, though he also gave $2 million to support DeSantis’ primary 
          effort last year.</p>

            <li><b>Stephen Schwarzman</b> also endorsed Trump for president</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Billionaire <b>Elon Musk</b> endorsed Donald Trump after an assassination attempt on the 
          former president at a Pennsylvania rally, marking a turning point for Musk and his 
          political shift toward the right in recent years.</p>
          <blockquote>
          “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk wrote in a 
          post on his social platform X alongside a video of the former president standing 
          and raising his fist after being shot in the ear.
          </blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Elon Musk</b><br>
              <p>Musk reportedly donated to a super PAC called America PAC. According to The New 
                York Times, some of Musk’s closest friends helped start it, creating an avenue 
                for Musk and his $250 billion fortune to play a significant role in the 2024 
                presidential race potentially.</p>
              <p>However, Musk this week denied media reports that he has pledged to donate $45 
                million a month to Trump’s campaign.</p>
              <p>But he isn’t the only billionaire throwing his support behind the Republican nominee.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Bill Ackman</b><br>
              <p>Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman also took the opportunity to formally endorse 
                Trump, posting on X, “A divided America is a weak America. Let’s help Trump succeed 
                and bring the country together.”</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>David Sacks, Jacqueline Sacks</b><br>
              <p>Venture capitalist and host of “The All-in Podcast” David Sacks took to X to 
                praise the decision of Trump picking Sen. JD Vance as his vice president.</p>
              <blockquote>
              “When the Twin Towers came down, J.D. Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps, gung-ho to 
              exact justice on America’s enemies,” Sacks wrote. “Subsequently he came to believe the 
              Forever Wars were a mistake. This is who I want by Trump’s side: an American patriot, 
              with the courage to fight America’s wars but the wisdom to know when to avoid them. 
              God bless J.D., God bless Trump, and God bless the USA.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sacks, along with his wife, Jacqueline Sacks, recently held a fundraiser for Trump 
                at his Pacific Heights mansion. The event was co-hosted by Sri Lankan businessman 
                Chamath Palihapitiya, who co-hosts the podcast with Sacks.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Timothy Mellon</b><br>
            <p>In May, a Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., received $50 million from businessman 
              Timothy Mellon following the former president’s conviction, according to NBC News. 
              The investment also followed the presumptive GOP nominee’s foray into 
              cryptocurrency, seemingly turning away from his previous aversion to the form of 
              payment.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Shaun Maguire</b><br>
              <p>Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, gave $300,000 to the Trump campaign

            <li><b>Douglas Leone</b><br>
              <p>Venture capitalist Douglas Leone, former managing partner at Sequoia Capital, 
              announced on X in June that he’d be supporting Trump. This support comes after 
              Leone said in 2021 that the former president had lost his support after the Jan. 
              6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>

            <li><b>Stephen Schwarzman</b><br>
              <p>Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman also endorsed Trump for president as 
                a “vote for change,” the Financial Times reported.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jamie Dimon</b><br>
              <p>J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who was urging fellow business leaders to back 
                former GOP candidate Nikki Haley, offered praise for Trump’s first-term policies 
                while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
              <blockquote>
                “Just take a step back and be honest,” Dimon said. “He was kind of right about NATO. 
                He was kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Trade, tax 
                reform worked. He was right about some of China.”

                and her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, donated to in the 2020 election cycle, has 
                been revived, and Adelson will be a “lead donor” this time around too, said Dave

          <!-- <h3>List of companies, schools, law offices who have PAID GRIFT to Trump "the don":<h3>  -->
          <ul>
          <li>Columbia University<br>
            <p>Has agreed to a $200 million fine to restore federal funding.</p></li>
          <li>Brown University<br>
            <p>Has agreed to pay $50 million to Rhode Island.</p></li>
          <li>University of Pennsylvania<br>
		    <p>Under a July agreement resolving a federal civil rights case, Penn modified a 
			trio of school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would 
			apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by Thomas’ participation on the 
			women’s swimming team.</p>
            <p>The Education Department investigated Penn as part of the administration’s broader 
			attempt to remove transgender athletes from girls and women’s sports. As part of the 
			case, the administration had suspended $175 million in funding to Penn.</p></li>
          <li>Harvard University<br>
            <p>The administration has frozen more than $2.6 billion in research grants to 
			Harvard, accusing the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university of allowing 
			antisemitism to flourish. Harvard has pushed back with several lawsuits. In 
			negotiations for a possible settlement, the administration is seeking for 
			Harvard to pay an amount far higher than Columbia.</p></li>
          <li>Cornell University<br>
            <p>The White House announced in April that it froze more than $1 billion of Cornell’s 
			federal funding as it investigated allegations of civil rights violations.</p>
            <p>The Ivy League school was among a group of more than 60 universities that received 
			a letter from the Education Department on March 10 urging them to take steps to protect 
			Jewish students or else face “potential enforcement actions.”</p></li>
          <li>Northwestern University<br>
            <p>Like Cornell, Northwestern saw a halt in some of its federal funding in April. The 
			amount was about $790 million, according to the administration.</p></li>
          <li>Duke University<br>
            <p>The administration this week froze $108 million in federal money for Duke. The 
			hold on funding from the National Institutes of Health came days after the departments 
			of Health and Human Services and Education sent a joint letter alleging racial 
			preferences in Duke’s hiring and admissions.</p></li>
          <li>Princeton University<br>
			<p>Dozens of research grants were suspended at Princeton without a clear rationale, 
			according to an April 1 campus message from the university’s president, Christopher 
			Eisgruber. The grants came from federal agencies such as the Department of Energy, 
			NASA and the Pentagon.</p></li>
